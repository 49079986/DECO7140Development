                            I'm Jake Thompson, a 19-year-old economics student.
                            I'm usually busy with my studies, but when it comes
                            to cooking, I seek speed and simplicity. I often
                            visit food websites to look for quick recipes on
                            Kuaishou, preferably those that can be prepared with
                            just a microwave oven or an electric rice cooker.
                            Sometimes I have no idea what to do at all and just
                            hope that the website can recommend recipes based on
                            what ingredients I have in my fridge.

                            I like refreshing and interesting website designs.

                            are unclear, I will directly close them. It would be
                            even better if there were pictures, short videos and
                            others' comments on the recipes.

                            important thing for a food website is efficiency:
                            straightforward steps, the ability to filter time
