                            different communities. Each website should serve as
                            a central hub where community members can share
                            resources, highlight events, and foster meaningful
                            connections. The websites must not include any form

                            selling products. However, it is acceptable to
                            promote resources, events, or services that are
                            directly beneficial to the community.

                                        food that can be made and reduce the
                                        difficulty of choosing "what to eat
                                        today".
