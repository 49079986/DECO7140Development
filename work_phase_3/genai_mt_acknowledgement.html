                                However, I also encountered challenges with the
                                AI‚Äôs responses. At times, the outputs were too
                                generic, especially when I asked for help
                                refining content for my target audience (young
                                users). The suggestions lacked contextual
                                awareness or included stereotypical ideas that
                                didn‚Äôt align with the nuanced preferences of my
                                user personas. To address this, I refined my
                                prompts by adding more specific context, such as
                                including user stories (e.g., Jake, Linda,
                                David) and detailed descriptions of intended
                                functionality or tone. This helped generate more
                                relevant and diverse outputs.

                                Another limitation involved AI-generated
                                explanations that were occasionally incomplete
                                or failed to account for real-world browser
                                behavior. For instance, suggested CSS rules for

                                hands-on testing, cross-reference with external
                                documentation, and revise the code accordingly.
                                These moments reinforced the importance of not
                                treating AI as a final authority, but rather as
                                a collaborative tool that still requires human
                                oversight and interpretation.

                                Ethical considerations played an important role
                                throughout my use of AI in the development of my
                                website. While ChatGPT provided useful guidance
                                on both technical and design aspects, I remained
                                aware of the potential risks associated with
                                bias, lack of inclusivity, and over-reliance on
                                AI-generated content. For example, when
                                generating content related to user personas or
                                tone of language, I noticed that some responses
                                leaned toward stereotypical assumptions about
                                young users or simplified user preferences. To
                                address this, I refined the prompts to reflect a
                                more diverse and realistic set of user
                                needs‚Äîsuch as those of time-constrained
                                students, working parents, and
                                professionals‚Äîensuring the final website content
                                was more inclusive and representative.

                                transparency. When the AI suggested code or
                                described how a feature should work, I made sure
                                not to rely on it blindly. Instead, I manually
                                tested each solution, reviewed documentation,
                                and made edits to ensure the implementation was
                                technically sound. This was particularly
                                important in sections like the viewer and
                                accordion components, where inaccuracies in

                                decisions remained transparent and explainable.

                                used ChatGPT as a thinking partner to enhance my
                                research and critical decision-making.
                                Initially, I sought assistance in distilling the
                                overall content of my website and aligning it
                                with the preferences of my target

                                first outputs offered general suggestions, I
                                quickly realized that deeper context
                                identification and content tailoring were
                                needed. I refined my prompts by providing
                                specific user stories and design decisions,
                                which helped me evaluate how my homepage could

                                When addressing technical components, such as

                                inquiries pushed me to think through the
                                functional logic and visual hierarchy of my
                                design, requiring me to break down UI structures
                                and reflect on what made them intuitive and

                                Similarly, for the Viewer and Card sections, I
                                encountered issues with image proportions, hover
                                behaviors, and CSS styling. Rather than relying
